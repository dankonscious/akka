            "answer": "<b>Aside from breaking down the fats in your diet, the liver is primarily a detoxification organ.</b> That means it helps filter out things in your blood that might be toxic, foreign, or even things that might be causing a reaction with different systems of your body. \n                      <br><br>\n                      Now, as one of the leading doctors in NYC, you would be shocked if I told you the things that appear in people's blood.

            "answer": "Absolutely. It does this through two different mechanisms. One is reducing the toxic load in your bloodstream that has accumulated from a liver that's not as healthy as it should be.\n                      <br><br>\n                      As mentioned, toxins in the bloodstream can be environmental, like from pollution, from the water supply, and absorbed into your skin while showering, or they can be in the form of pesticides on fruits and vegetables.  \n                      <br><br>\n                      Prescription drugs, especially taken over long periods, will cause toxins to build up as well.\n                      <br><br>\n                      These are all handled by a healthy liver. <b>And when you detoxify, cleanse, and rejuvenate your liver, your body just gets better at clearing this stuff out.</b>\n                      <br><br>\n                      You might be shocked to reach a level of clarity you haven't experienced since you were young.  I've seen eyes brighten up, skin clear like magic, even joint pain vanish in just a few weeks.\n                      <br><br>\n                      <b>Now, the second is through microbiome recomposition</b> - that is, repopulating your microbiome with the most powerful superbiotic known to man. The mental benefits of Akkermansia have been demonstrated in over 150 scientific studies.\n                      <br><br>\n                      More broadly, probiotics in general have literally thousands of clinical studies showing their mental benefits improving memory, concentration, focus, and even a dramatic lift in your mood, since 85% of your body's serotonin is produced in the gut.  \n                      <br><br>\n                      <b>Akkermansia is the master superbiotic, feeding and nurturing nearly every beneficial strain in your gut.</b>\n                      <br><br>\n                      You've never seen anything like it, and I promise you, no amount of exercise, caffeine, energy drinks, or drugs can compete with the mental clarity and focus you'll experience from naturally improving your microbiome.\n                      <br><br>\n                      Every day I get emails from people who have improved their memory, been able to focus for longer periods of time, and have even reported making more money as a result."

Not only are the ingredients tested for quality and safety, they are also tested for purity and potency as well.  \n                      <br><br>\n                      <b>We also conduct additional quality inspections to ensure that the ingredients do not contain heavy metals, allergens, or contaminants, and meet the highest purity standards.</b>\n                      <br><br>\n                      It's important to make sure that these ingredients retain their full potency, so that the product will actually deliver the benefits we talk about.\n                      <br><br>\n                      The second reason we only sell direct is to keep the price affordable for our valued customers. \n                      <br><br>\n                      If we allowed Akka to be sold in the big natural food stores, the markup required would make the price at least double what it is now. \n                      <br><br>\n                      For our customers, all that extra markup makes no sense.
