            <div class="color1D1D1F myriadpro fs18 fw400 fsm16">
               <p><em>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.</em> You and Konscious Brands agree that this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (<b>“FAA”</b>), and not by any state law concerning arbitration; and that any dispute between us, including disputes by either of us against any agent, employee, subsidiary, affiliate, predecessor in interest, successor, or assign of the other, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration, except for disputes arising from an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or breach of confidentiality, for which the injured party may suffer irreparable harm and may seek a restraining order, preliminary injunctive relief, an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief and/or legal remedies, and actions to enforce the decisions of the arbitrators, for which action may be taken in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. Additionally, Konscious Brands may seek and obtain equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction as described in Section 16, below.</p>
               <p class="fw700">BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</p>
               <p>In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal, however, but an arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<b>“AAA”</b>) and conducted under AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the <b>“AAA Rules”</b>) then in effect at the time of the dispute. You may obtain copies of the AAA Rules and forms and instructions for initiating an arbitration by visiting the AAA website at www.adr.org, or by calling AAA at (800) 788-7879.</p>
               <p><em>Selection of Arbitrator and Costs</em>. If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum. To initiate an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to us at: Konscious Brands, 151 Calle De San Francisco Pmb 5585, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00901. If you initiate an arbitration, Konscious Brands will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under the AAA Rules once you have notified Konscious Brands in writing and provided a copy of the Demand for Arbitration. However, if Konscious Brands is the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys’ fees and costs to Konscious Brands including the filing fee.</p>
               <p><em>Class Action and Trial-by-Jury Waiver</em>. THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIM TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS OR IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO CLAIM SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION WILL BE HEARD BY A JURY OR MAY BE BROUGHT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACT AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims against Konscious Brands and may not preside over any representative or class proceeding against Konscious Brands. You acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is non-severable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void, and in such instance any dispute between us will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts located in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and you and Konscious Brands consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in these courts.</p>
               <p class="mb-0">YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST KONSCIOUS BRANDS IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED A PRODUCT, AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING TERMS, YOU MUST TELL US IN WRITING AND RETURN THE PRODUCT TO GET A REFUND. IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED THE PRODUCT AT A RETAIL STORE, YOU MUST RETURN THE PRODUCT ACCORDING TO THE STORE’S RETURN POLICY. IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED THE PRODUCT BY TELEPHONE OR ONLINE FROM US, YOU MUST RETURN THE PRODUCT PURSUANT TO OUR <a href="https://tryakka.com/pages/shipping-refund-policy" target="_blank" class="color00E">RETURN POLICY.</a></p>
